# Planarity

The [`planarity` repository](https://github.com/graph-algorithms/planarity)
provides the source code for the [`planarity` Python
package](https://pypi.org/project/planarity/). The `planarity` package was
originally developed to provide Python and
[NetworkX](https://pypi.org/project/networkx/) developers with a Python API to
access planar graph testing, embedding, drawing, and forbidden subgraph
isolation algorithms from the [Edge Addition Planarity Suite
(EAPS)](https://github.com/graph-algorithms/edge-addition-planarity-suite).

The `planarity` repository has now been transferred to the [Github Graph
Algorithms Organization](https://github.com/graph-algorithms). The `planarity`
repository and Python package have been updated with the full set of
planarity-related algorithms from
[EAPS](https://github.com/graph-algorithms/edge-addition-planarity-suite) as
well as all public methods from its generalized graph library to enable
development of a wide range of high-performance graph algorithms and
applications.

## Example

```python
In [1]: # Example of the complete graph of 5 nodes, K5, which is not planar.

In [2]: import planarity

In [3]: edgelist = [('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c'), ('a', 'd'), ('a', 'e'),
   ...:             ('b', 'c'),('b', 'd'),('b', 'e'),
   ...:             ('c', 'd'), ('c', 'e'),
   ...:             ('d', 'e')]

In [4]: print(planarity.is_planar(edgelist))
False

In [5]: # Remove an edge to make the graph planar

In [6]: edgelist.remove(('a','b'))

In [7]: print(planarity.is_planar(edgelist))
True

In [8]: # Make an ascii text drawing

In [9]: # Create single instance of PGraph from edgelist upon which to operate

In [10]: P = planarity.PGraph(edgelist)

In [11]: # Produce mapping of nodes to their original labels

In [12]: print(P.mapping())
{1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c', 4: 'd', 5: 'e'}

In [13]: # Make text drawing

In [14]: print(P.ascii())
```

Note that edge `(a, b)` would correspond to an edge between vertex indexes
`(1, 2)`, which is not present in the drawing of this planar graph.

Also note that if the vertices are represented by objects that do not support
the comparison operator, you may not be able to produce the same mapping
consistently between sessions, since we sort the labels before initializing the
underlying C graph datastructure instance.
