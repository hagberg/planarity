      Used in the edge records (arcs) of a reduction edge to indicate the
      endpoints of a path that has been reduced from (removed from) the
      embedding so that the search for a K4 can continue.
	  We only need a pathConnector because we reduce subgraphs that are
	  separable by a 2-cut, so they can contribute at most one path to a
	  subgraph homeomorphic to K4, if one is indeed found. Thus, we first
	  delete all edges except for the desired path(s), then we reduce any
	  retained path to an edge.
