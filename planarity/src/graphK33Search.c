            OPTIMIZATION: We do not need to check for this case.
            We avoid doing so because in very specially crafted cases
            it could be too costly if the connection doesn't exist.
            However, if the highest numbered ancestor H of the current vertex

            Minors A and B both provide a K_{3,3} when found.

            This happens because w is pertinent to H and future pertinent
            to u_max or an ancestor of u_max.

            Minor A will happen if, in step H, Walkdown descends to the
            bicomp containing the current vertex, x, y and w.  Since x
            and y would still be future pertinent (they connect to u_max
            or higher, i.e. with lesser DFI, than u_max).

            Minor B will happen if the bicomp containing the current vertex,
            x, y and w is a descendant of a bicomp that blocks planarity
            in step H.  The bicomp would be both pertinent (due to w's

            NOTE: Due to the prior use of the Kuratowski subgraph

 _TestForZtoWPath()
 This function tests whether there is a path inside the bicomp leading from W
 to some internal node of the x-y path.  If there is, the path is marked (the
 visited flags of its vertices and edges are set).

 Upon function return, the marking (visited flag setting) of W distinguishes
 whether the path was found.

 The function returns NOTOK on internal error, OK otherwise.

 Preconditions: All internal vertices have an obstruction type setting of
 unknown, as do W and the bicomp root.  There is an X-Y path marked visited.
 So, we start a depth first search from W to find a visited vertex, except
 we prune the search to ignore vertices whose obstruction type is other than
 unknown.  This ensures the path found, if any, avoids external face vertices,
 including avoiding X and Y. Furthermore, the path search is completed without
 traversing to R due to the obstructing X-Y path.

 The depth first search has to "mark" the vertices it has seen as visited,
 but the visited flags are already in use to distinguish the X-Y path.
 So, we reuse the visitedInfo setting of each vertex. The core planarity
 algorithm makes settings between 0 and N, so we will regard all of those
 as indicating 'unvisited' by this method, and use -1 to indicate visited.
 These markings need not be cleaned up because, if the desired path is found
 the a K_{3,3} is isolated and if the desired path is not found then the
 bicomp is reduced and the visitedInfo in the remaining vertices are set
 appropriately for future Walkup processing of the core planarity algorithm.

 For each vertex we visit, if it is an internal vertex on the X-Y path
 (i.e. visited flag set and obstruction type unknown), then we want to stop
 and unroll the stack to obtain the desired path (described below). If the
 vertex is internal but not on the X-Y path (i.e. visited flag clear and
 obstruction type unknown), then we want to visit its neighbors, except
 those already marked visited by this method (i.e. those with visitedInfo
 of -1) and those with a known obstruction type.

 We want to manage the stack so that it when the desired vertex is found,
 the stack contains the desired path.  So, we do not simply push all the
 neighbors of the vertex being visited.  First, given that we have popped
 some vertex-edge pair (v, e), we push *only* the next edge after e in
 v's adjacency list (starting with the first if e is NIL) that leads to a
 new 'eligible' vertex.  An eligible vertex is one whose obstruction type
 is unknown and whose visitedInfo is other than -1 (so, internal and not
 yet processed by this method). Second, when we decide a new vertex w
 adjacent to v is eligible, we push not only (v, e) but also (w, NIL).
 When we later pop the vertex-edge pair containing NIL, we know that
 the vertex obstruction type is unknown so we test whether its visited
 flag is set (indicating an internal vertex on the X-Y path).  If so, then
 we can stop the depth first search, then use the vertices and edges
 remaining on the stack to mark the desired path from the external face
 vertex W to an internal vertex Z on the X-Y path.

 If we pop (v, NIL) and find that the visited flag of v is clear, then it
 is not the desired connection endpoint to the X-Y path.  We need to process
 all paths extending from it, but we don't want any of those paths to cycle
 back to this vertex, so we mark it as ineligible by putting -1 in its
 visitedInfo member.  This is also the case in which the _first_ edge record e
 leading from v to an eligible vertex w is obtained, whereupon we push both
 (v, e) and (w, NIL).  Eventually all paths leading from w to eligible
 vertices will be explored, and if none find the desired vertex connection
 to the X-Y path, then (v, e) is popped.  Now we search the adjacency list of
 v starting after e to find the _next_ edge record that indicates the an
 eligible vertex to visit.  None of the vertices processed while visiting paths
 extending from w will be eligible anymore, so it can be seen that this method
 is a depth first search. If no remaining edges from v indicate eligible
 vertices, then nothing is pushed and we simply go to the next iteration,
 which pops a 2-tuple containing the vertex u and the edge record e that
 points to v.  Finally, if the stack empties without finding the desired vertex,
 then the first loop ends, and the second main loop does not mark a path because
 the stack is empty.

/****************************************************************************
 _TestForStraddlingBridge()
 We proceed on the path [V...u_{max}) from the current vertex V up to and
 excluding u_{max}.  For each vertex p, we test whether p has a least
 ancestor less than u_{max} and whether p has a DFS child c that is not an
 ancestor of X, Y and W and that has a connection to an ancestor of u_{max}
 (in other words, whether the child C has a lowpoint less than u_{max}).

 The sortedDFSChildLIst of the vertex p is scanned for the separated DFS
 child c of least lowpoint, excluding the ancestor of X, Y and W.

 If no bridge straddling u_{max} is found, the function returns NIL.
 If a straddling bridge is found, the function returns a descendant d
 of p in the subtree rooted by c such that d has a leastAncestor less
 than u_{max}.  Given the vertex d, the path through the straddling
 bridge required in Minors E6 and E7 is easy to identify:  Mark the
 DFS tree path from d to p, and add and mark the edge from d to its
 least ancestor.

 OPTIMIZATION: If a straddling bridge is not found, then in each tree edge of
        the path [V...u_{max}) we set the member noStraddle equal to u_{max}.
        Then, we modify the above stated routine so that if it is testing
        for a straddling bridge of u_{max} along this path, it will stop
        if it encounters an edge with noStraddle equal to u_{max}.
        Also, the optimization will only set noStraddle equal to
        u_{max} on the portion of the path that is traversed.  Finally, if
        noStraddle is set to a value other than NIL, the setting will be
        ignored and it will not be changed.

        Due to this optimization, we do not traverse a path more than once
        to find out whether a vertex on the path has a bridge that straddles
        u_{max}.  This leaves two questions:
            1) What if a future step must determine whether there is a
                straddling bridge of an ancestor of u_{max}?
            2) What if a future step must determine whether there is a
                straddling bridge of a descendant of u_{max}?

        The condition described in the first question cannot occur because it
        would imply the ability to detect a straddling bridge now.
        The condition described by the second question may occur, but in the
        future step, the bicomp now being tested for a K_{3,3} will be part of
        a straddling bridge in that future step.  Thus, the straddling
        bridge query is asked at most twice along any DFS tree path.

 _ReduceBicomp()

 We want to reduce the given biconnected component to a 4-cycle plus an
 internal edge connecting X and Y.  Each edge is to be associated with a
 path from the original graph, preserving the depth first search tree
 paths that help connect the vertices R, X, Y, and W.  If a K_{3,3} is later found,
 the paths are restored, but it is necessary to preserve the DFS tree so that
 functions like MarkDFSPath() will be able to pass through the restored bicomp.
 Also, if a K_{3,3} is later found due to the merge blocker optimization, then the
 internal X-Y path may be needed and, once the bicomp reduction is reversed,
 a full DFS subtree connecting all vertices in the bicomp will need to be
 restored or else functions that traverse the bicomp will not work.

 For example, _FindK33WithMergeBlocker() invokes ChooseTypeOfNonplanarityMinor()
 to help reconstruct the context under which the mergeBlocker was set.
 ChooseTypeOfNonplanarityMinor() calls _ClearVisitedFlagsInBicomp(), which
 depends on the DFS tree.

 NOTE: The following are some general steps taken in this method:
       1) All edges in the bicomp are marked unvisited
       2) selected paths are marked visited
       3) unvisited edges are deleted
       4) the edges of the bicomp are marked unvisited again
       5) the remaining paths of the bicomp are reduced
       Some of the edges that get deleted in step 3 above may represent
       paths that were reduced in prior embedder iterations.  We delete
       the reduction edge but not the path it represents.
       If a K_{3,3} is ever found, then the edges of these reduced paths
       are still in the graph, though not connected to anything important.
       The desired K_{3,3} is marked visited, but step 4 above ensures that
       these reduction paths are not marked visited. Hence, they will be
       deleted when the K_{3,3} is isolated, and this routine does not
       need to restore any reduced paths on the edges it deletes.
       We also don't (and don't have the time to) restore any reduction
       edges along the paths we intend to keep.
