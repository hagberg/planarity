 edges leading from a DFS tree descendant to an ancestor-- both DFS tree
 edges and back arcs.  The forward arcs are moved to the end of the

 gp_SortVertices()
 Once depth first numbering has been applied to the graph, the index
 member of each vertex contains the DFI.  This routine can reorder the
 vertices in linear time so that they appear in ascending order by DFI.
 Note that the index field is then used to store the original number
 of the vertex. Therefore, a second call to this method will put the
 vertices back to the original order and put the DFIs back into the
 index fields of the vertices.

 NOTE: This function is used by the core planarity algorithm, once its
 custom DFS has assigned DFIs to the vertices.  Once gp_Embed() has
 finished creating an embedding or obstructing subgraph, this function
 can be called to restore the original vertex numbering, if needed.

 gp_LowpointAndLeastAncestor()
        leastAncestor(v): min(v, ancestor neighbors of v, excluding parent)

 Lowpoint is computed via a post-order traversal of the DFS tree.
 We push the root of the DFS tree, then we loop while the stack is not empty.
 We pop a vertex; if it is not marked, then we are on our way down the DFS
 tree, so we mark it and push it back on, followed by pushing its
 DFS children.  The next time we pop the node, all of its children
 will have been popped, marked+children pushed, and popped again.  On
 the second pop of the vertex, we can therefore compute the lowpoint
 values based on the childrens' lowpoints and the least ancestor from
 among the edges in the vertex's adjacency list.

 If they have not already been performed, gp_CreateDFSTree() and
 gp_SortVertices() are invoked on the graph, and it is left in the
 sorted state on completion of this method.

 NOTE: This is a utility function provided for general use of the graph
 library. The core planarity algorithm computes leastAncestor during its
 initial DFS, and it computes the lowpoint of a vertex as it embeds the
 tree edges to its children.
