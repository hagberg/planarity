/********************************************************************
 The extension mechanism allows new modules to equip a graph with the
 data structures and functions needed to implement new algorithms
 without impeding the performance of the core graph planar embedding
 algorithms on graphs that have not been so equipped.

 The following steps must be used to create a graph extension:

  1) Create a moduleID variable initialized to zero that will be
     assigned a positive integer the first time the extension is
     added to a graph by gp_AddExtension()

  2) Define an extension context structure to contain all of the data
     and function pointers that extend the graph.  The context must
     include a graphFunctionTable to allow overloading of functions.
     An instance of this context structure is passed to the "context"
     parameter of gp_AddExtension().

  3) Define a function capable of duplicating your context data
     structure.  It receives a void pointer indicating the context
     to duplicate and a void pointer that can be cast to a graph
     pointer indicating the graph for which the context is being
     duplicated.  The void pointer returned indicates the newly
     allocated context structure.  The pointer to this function is
     passed to the "dupContext" parameter of gp_AddExtension()

     Note: It is useful to store in your context structure a pointer
     to the graph that the context is extending.  There are certain
     function overloads you will perform that will only receive
     the context, and you may need to know things about the graph,
     such as the number of vertices or edges.

  4) Define a function that can free the memory used by your context
     data structure.  It will receive a void pointer indicating the
     instance of your context data structure that you passed as the
     "context" parameter to gp_AddExtension().
     The free function pointer should be passed as the "freeContext"
     parameter to gp_AddExtension()

  5) The expected method of attaching your feature to a graph is to
     create a function called gp_AttachFeature(), where 'Feature' is
     the name of your module.  The attach function allocates your context
     data structure, initializes the extension data, assigns overload
     function pointers, and invokes gp_AddExtension().

     NOTE: It is advisable to use memset on the context function table
     before assigning any function overloads because any function not
     being overloaded must have a NULL pointer.

     NOTE: The gp_AddExtension() method puts the overload function
     pointers into the graph's function table, and the base function
     pointers that were overloaded are placed in the context function
     table.  This allows the extension's functions to have access to
     base function behaviors, since many extension functions will
     extend rather than replace the base behavior.

  6) There are a few functions that you must overload in order to
     successfully manage data structures that are parallel to the
     main graph data structures.

     The core graph data structure has function pointers to functions
     that can be overloaded.  In addition to invoking gp_AddExtension(),
     you need to set pointers to your own versions of the functions
     you are overloading.  You will also need to store a copy of the
     prior pointer in your feature's context data structure so that you
     can invoke the "base" behavior from your function overload, e.g.
     if your feature is attached but not active or if your feature
     augments the base behavior rather than replacing it.

     a) If any kind of data structures needs to be maintained at
        the graph, vertex or edge levels, then an overload of
        fpInitGraph() will be needed.

     b) If any data must be associated with primary and virtual vertices,
        then an overload of fpInitVertexRec() is needed.  If data must be
        associated only with primary vertices (0 to N-1), then one can
        overload fpInitVertexInfo() instead.
        The overload function should be named _Feature_InitVertexRec()
        or _Feature_InitVertexInfo().
        It will invoke the base fpInitVertexRec() or fpInitVertexInfo()
        but then also invoke a second function named _InitFeatureVertexRec()
        or _InitFeatureVertexInfo() thatinitializes the custom VertexRec
        or VertexInfo data members.

     c) If any data must be associated with the edges, then an overload
        of fpInitEdgeRec() is needed.
        This overload function should be named _Feature_InitEdgeRec().
        It will invoke the base fpInitEdgeRec() and also invoke
        a second function named_InitFeatureEdgeRec() that
        initializes the custom EdgeRec data members

     d) If any graph-level data structures are needed, then an
        overload of fpReinitializeGraph() will also be needed, not just the
        overload of fpInitGraph().  However, if only vertex-level and/or
        edge level data members are needed, then the overloads of
        fpInitVertexRec(), fpInitVertexInfo() and/or fpInitEdgeRec() are
        invoked by the basic fpReinitializeGraph without needing to overload
        it as well.

     e) If any data must be persisted in the file format, then overloads
        of fpReadPostprocess() and fpWritePostprocess() are needed.

  7) Define internal functions for _Feature_ClearStructures(),
     _Feature_CreateStructures() and _Feature_InitStructures();

     a) The _Feature_ClearStructures() should simply null out pointers
        to extra structures on its first invocation, but thereafter it
        should free them and then null them.  Since the null-only step
        is done only once in gp_AttachFeature(), it seems reasonable to
        not bother with a more complicated _Feature_ClearStructures().
        But, as an extension is developed, the data structures change,
        so it is best to keep all this logic in one place.

     b) The _Feature_CreateStructures() should just allocate memory for
        but not initialize any vertex level and edge level data structures.
        Data structures maintained at the graph level, such as a stack or a
        list collection, should be created _and_ initialized.

     c) The _Feature_InitStructures() should invoke just the functions
        needed to initialize the custom VertexRec, VertexInfo and EdgeRec
        data members, if any.

  8) Define a function gp_DetachFeature() that invokes gp_RemoveExtension()
     This should be done for consistency, so that users of a feature
     do not attach it with gp_AttachFeature() and remove it with
     gp_RemoveExtension().  However, it may sometimes be necessary to
     run more code than just gp_RemoveExtension() when detaching a feature,
     e.g. some final result values of a feature may be saved to data
     available in the core graph or in other features.

 @param theGraph - pointer to the graph to which the extension is being added

 @param dupContext - a function capable of duplicating the context data
 @param freeContext - a function capable of freeing the context data
 @param functions - pointer to a table of functions stored in the data context.
                        The table of functions is an input and output parameter.
                        On input, the table consists of new function pointers
                        for functions being overloaded.
                        Any function not being overloaded must be NULL.
                        The non-NULL function pointers are used to overload
                        the functions in the graph, and the prior pointer values
                        in the graph are stored in the function table as output.
                        The context data therefore has the pointer to the base
                        function corresponding to any function its extension
                        module overloaded.

/********************************************************************
 _OverloadFunctions()
 For each non-NULL function pointer, the pointer becomes the new value
 for the function in the graph, and the old function pointer in the graph
 is placed in the overload table.

 This way, when an extension function is invoked, it can choose to invoke
 the base function before or after whatever extension behavior it provides.

 Also, when it comes time to remove an extension, this extension system
 has access to the overload tables of all extensions so that it can unhook
 the functions of the module being removed from the chains of calls for
 each overloaded function.  This will involve some pointer changes in
 the overload tables of extensions other than the one being removed.
