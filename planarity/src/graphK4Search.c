 vertices or label the vertices of its external face.
 This is necessary in particular because of the reduction processing on
 MINORTYPE_B.  When a K2,3 is found by minor B, we may not be able to find
 an entangled K4, so a reduction is performed, but it only eliminates
 part of the bicomp and the operations here need to avoid touching parts
 of the bicomp that won't be reduced, except by a constant amount of course.

 _K4_FindSeparatingInternalEdge()

 Logically, this method is similar to calling MarkHighestXYPath() to
 see if there is an internal separator between R and A.
 However, that method cannot be called because the bicomp is not oriented.

 Because this is an outerplanarity related algorithm, there are no internal
 vertices to contend with, so it is easier to inspect the internal edges
 incident to each vertex internal to the path (R ... A), i.e. excluding endpoints,
 to see whether any of the edges connects outside of the path [R ... A],
 including endpoints.

 In order to avoid adding cost to the core planarity algorithm, we'll just use
 the fact that the vertex obstruction types are pre-initialized to the unmarked
 state.  Until we know if there is a separating internal edge, we cannot be sure
 that we can isolate a K4 homeomorph, so we can't afford to initialize the whole
 bicomp. The obstruction type of each vertex along the path [R ... A] is marked.
 Then, for each vertex in the range (R ... A), if there is any edge that is also
 incident to a vertex whose obstruction type is still unmarked, then that edge
 is the desired separator edge between R and W (i.e. A), and so we save information
 about it.

 If the separator edge is found, then this method sets the *pW to A, and it
 sets *pX and *pY values with the endpoints of the separator edge.
 The visited flags of the separator edge and its endpoint vertices are not set
 at this time because it is easier to set them later as part of the overall K4
 homeomorph isolation.

 Lastly, we restore the unmarked obstruction type settings on the path [R ... A].

/****************************************************************************
 _K4_ReducePathComponent()

 This method is invoked when the bicomp rooted by R contains a component
 subgraph that is separable from the bicomp by the 2-cut (R, A). The K_4
 homeomorph isolator will have processed a significant fraction of the
 component, and so it must be reduced to an edge to ensure that said
 processing happens at most once on the component (except for future
 operations that are bound to linear time in total by other arguments).

 Because the bicomp is an outerplanar embedding, the component is known to
 consists of an external face path plus some internal edges that are parallel
 to that path. Otherwise, it wouldn't be separable by the 2-cut (R, A).

 The goal of this method is to reduce the component to the edge (R, A). This
 is done in such a way that, if the reduction must be restored, the DFS tree
 structure connecting the restored vertices is retained.

 The first step is to ensure that (R, A) is not already just an edge, in which
 case no reduction is needed. This can occur if A is future pertinent.

 Assuming a non-trivial reduction component, the next step is to determine
 the DFS tree structure within the component. Because it is separable by the
 2-cut (R, A), there are only two cases:

 Case 1: The DFS tree path from A to R is within the reduction component.

 In this case, the DFS tree path is marked, the remaining edges of the
 reduction component are eliminated, and then the DFS tree path is reduced to
 the the tree edge (R, A).

 Note that the reduction component may also contain descendants of A as well
 as vertices that are descendant to R but are neither ancestors nor
 descendants of A. This depends on where the tree edge from R meets the
 external face path (R ... A). However, the reduction component can only
 contribute one path to any future K_4, so it suffices to preserve only the
 DFS tree path (A --> R).

 Case 2: The DFS tree path from A to R is not within the reduction component.

 In this case, the external face edge from R leads to a descendant D of A.
 We mark that back edge (R, D) plus the DFS tree path (D --> A). The
 remaining edges of the reduction component can be removed, and then the
 path (R, D, ..., A) is reduced to the edge (R, A).

 For the sake of contradiction, suppose that only part of the DFS tree path
 from A to R were contained by the reduction component. Then, a DFS tree edge
 would have to exit the reduction component and connect to some vertex not
 on the external face path (R, ..., A). This contradicts the assumption that
 the reduction subgraph is separable from the bicomp by the 2-cut (R, A).

 Returns OK for success, NOTOK for internal (implementation) error.
