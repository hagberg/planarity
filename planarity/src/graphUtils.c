 gp_InitGraph()
 Allocates memory for vertex and edge records now that N is known.
 The arcCapacity is set to (2 * DEFAULT_EDGE_LIMIT * N) unless it
	 has already been set by gp_EnsureArcCapacity()

 For V, we need 2N vertex records, N for vertices and N for virtual vertices (root copies).

 For VI, we need N vertexInfo records.

 For E, we need arcCapacity edge records.

 The BicompRootLists and sortedDFSChildLists are of size N and start out empty.

 The stack, initially empty, is made big enough for a pair of integers
	 per edge record (2 * arcCapacity), or 6N integers if the arcCapacity
	 was set below the default value.

 The edgeHoles stack, initially empty, is set to arcCapacity / 2,
	 which is big enough to push every edge (to indicate an edge
	 you only need to indicate one of its two edge records)

  Returns OK on success, NOTOK on all failures.
          On NOTOK, graph extensions are freed so that the graph is
          returned to the post-condition of gp_New().

 gp_EnsureArcCapacity()
 This method ensures that theGraph is or will be capable of storing
 at least requiredArcCapacity edge records.  Two edge records are
 needed per edge.

 This method is most performant when invoked immediately after
 gp_New(), since it must only set the arcCapacity and then let
 normal initialization to occur through gp_InitGraph().

 This method is also a constant time operation if the graph already
 has at least the requiredArcCapacity, since it will return OK
 without making any structural changes.

 This method is generally more performant if it is invoked before
 attaching extensions to the graph.  Some extensions associate
 parallel data with edge records, which is a faster operation if
 the associated data is created and initialized only after the
 proper arcCapacity is specified.

 If the graph has been initialized and has a lower arc capacity,
 then the array of edge records is reallocated to satisfy the
 requiredArcCapacity.  The new array contains the old edges and
 edge holes at the same locations, and all newly created edge records
 are initialized.

 Also, if the arc capacity must be increased, then the
 arcCapacity member of theGraph is changed and both
 theStack and edgeHoles are expanded (since the sizes of both
 are based on the arc capacity).

 Extensions that add to data associated with edges must overload
 this method to ensure capacity in the parallel extension data
 structures.  An extension can return NOTOK if it does not
 support arc capacity expansion.  The extension function will
 not be called if arcCapacity is expanded before the graph is
 initialized, and it is assumed that extensions will allocate
 parallel data structures according to the arc capacity.

 If an extension supports arc capacity expansion, then higher
 performance can be obtained by using the method of unhooking
 the initializers for individual edge records before invoking
 the superclass version of fpEnsureArcCapacity().  Ideally,
 application authors should ensure the proper arc capacity before
 attaching extensions to achieve better performance.

 Returns NOTOK on failure to reallocate the edge record array to
         satisfy the requiredArcCapacity, or if the requested
         capacity is odd

 This routine detaches arc from its adjacency list, but it does not delete

 Some algorithms must temporarily detach an edge, perform some calculation,

 The neighboring adjacency list nodes are cross-linked, but the two link
 members of the arc are retained, so the arc can be reattached later by
 invoking _RestoreArc().  A sequence of detached arcs can only be restored
 in the exact opposite order of their detachment.  Thus, algorithms do not
 directly use this method to implement the temporary detach/restore method.
 Instead, gp_HideEdge() and gp_RestoreEdge are used, and algorithms push
 edge hidden edge onto the stack.  One example of this stack usage is
 provided by detaching edges with gp_ContractEdge() or gp_IdentifyVertices(),
 and reattaching with gp_RestoreIdentifications(), which unwinds the stack
 by invoking gp_RestoreVertex().

/********************************************************************
 gp_IdentifyVertices()

 Identifies vertex v with vertex u by transferring all adjacencies
 of v to u.  Any duplicate edges are removed as described below.
 The non-duplicate edges of v are added to the adjacency list of u
 without disturbing their relative order, and they are added before
 the edge record eBefore in u's list. If eBefore is NIL, then the
 edges are simply appended to u's list.

 If u and v are adjacent, then gp_HideEdge() is invoked to remove
 the edge e=(u,v). Then, the edges of v that indicate neighbors of
 u are also hidden.  This is done by setting the visited flags of
 u's neighbors, then traversing the adjacency list of v.  For each
 visited neighbor of v, the edge is hidden because it would duplicate
 an adjacency already expressed in u's list. Finally, the remaining
 edges of v are moved to u's list, and each twin arc is adjusted
 to indicate u as a neighbor rather than v.

 This routine assumes that the visited flags are clear beforehand,
 and visited flag settings made herein are cleared before returning.

 The following are pushed, in order, onto the graph's built-in stack:
 1) an integer for each hidden edge
 2) the stack size before any hidden edges were pushed
 3) six integers that indicate u, v and the edges moved from v to u

 An algorithm that identifies a series of vertices, either through
 directly calling this method or via gp_ContractEdge(), can unwind
 the identifications using gp_RestoreIdentifications(), which
 invokes gp_RestoreVertex() repeatedly.

 Returns OK on success, NOTOK on internal failure

/********************************************************************
 gp_RestoreVertex()

 This method assumes the built-in graph stack contents are the result
 of vertex hide, vertex identify and edge contract operations.
 This content consists of segments of integers, each segment
 corresponding to the removal of a vertex during an edge contraction
 or vertex identification in which a vertex v was merged into a
 vertex u.  The segment contains two blocks of integers.
 The first block contains information about u, v, the edge records
 in v's adjacency list that were added to u, and where in u's
 adjacency list they were added.  The second block of integers
 contains a list of edges incident to v that were hidden from the
 graph because they were incident to neighbors of v that were also
 neighbors of u (so they would have produced duplicate edges had
 they been left in v's adjacency list when it was merged with u's
 adjacency list).

 This method pops the first block of the segment off the stack and
 uses the information to help remove v's adjacency list from u and
 restore it into v.  Then, the second block is removed from the
 stack, and each indicated edge is restored from the hidden state.

 It is anticipated that this method will be overloaded by extension
 algorithms to perform some processing as each vertex is restored.
 Before restoration, the topmost segment has the following structure:

 ... FHE ... LHE HESB e_u_succ e_v_last e_v_first e_u_pred u v
      ^------------|

 FHE = First hidden edge
 LHE = Last hidden edge
 HESB = Hidden edge stack bottom
 e_u_succ, e_u_pred = The edges of u between which the edges of v
                      were inserted. NIL can appear if the edges of v
                      were added to the beginning or end of u's list
 e_v_first, e_v_last = The first and last edges of v's list, once
                       the hidden edges were removed
