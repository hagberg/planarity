 Edge Record Definition

 An edge is defined by a pair of edge records, or arcs, allocated in
 array E of a graph.  An edge record represents the edge in the
 adjacency list of each vertex to which the edge is incident.

 link[2]: the next and previous edge records (arcs) in the adjacency
          list that contains this edge record.

 v: The vertex neighbor of the vertex whose adjacency list contains
    this edge record (an index into array V).

 flags: Bits 0-15 reserved for library; bits 16 and higher for apps
        Bit 0: Visited
        Bit 1: DFS type has been set, versus not set
        Bit 2: DFS tree edge, versus cycle edge (co-tree edge, etc.)
        Bit 3: DFS arc to descendant, versus arc to ancestor
        Bit 4: Inverted (same as marking an edge with a "sign" of -1)
        Bit 5: Arc is directed into the containing vertex only
        Bit 6: Arc is directed from the containing vertex only

 Vertex Record Definition

 This record definition provides the data members needed for the
 core structural information for both vertices and virtual vertices.
 Vertices are also equipped with additional information provided by
 the vertexInfo structure.

 The vertices of a graph are stored in the first N locations of array V.
 Virtual vertices are secondary vertices used to help represent the
 main vertices in substructural components of a graph (e.g. biconnected
 components).

 link[2]: the first and last edge records (arcs) in the adjacency list
          of the vertex.

 index: In vertices, stores either the depth first index of a vertex or
        the original array index of the vertex if the vertices of the
        graph are sorted by DFI.
        In virtual vertices, the index may be used to indicate the vertex
        that the virtual vertex represents, unless an algorithm has some
        other way of making the association (for example, the planarity
        algorithms rely on biconnected components and therefore place
        virtual vertices of a vertex at positions corresponding to the
        DFS children of the vertex).

 flags: Bits 0-15 reserved for library; bits 16 and higher for apps
        Bit 0: visited, for vertices and virtual vertices
				Use in lieu of TYPE_VERTEX_VISITED in K4 algorithm
		Bit 1: Obstruction type VERTEX_TYPE_SET (versus not set, i.e. VERTEX_TYPE_UNKNOWN)
		Bit 2: Obstruction type qualifier RYW (set) versus RXW (clear)
		Bit 3: Obstruction type qualifier high (set) versus low (clear)

 Vertex Info Structure Definition.

 This structure equips the primary (non-virtual) vertices with additional
 information needed for lowpoint and planarity-related algorithms.

	parent: The DFI of the DFS tree parent of this vertex
	leastAncestor: min(DFI of neighbors connected by backedge)
	lowpoint: min(leastAncestor, min(lowpoint of DFS Children))

	visitedInfo: enables algorithms to manage vertex visitation with more than
				 just a flag.  For example, the planarity test flags visitation
				 as a step number that implicitly resets on each step, whereas
				 part of the planar drawing method signifies a first visitation
				 by storing the index of the first edge used to reach a vertex
	pertinentEdge: Used by the planarity method; during Walkup, each vertex
	            that is directly adjacent via a back edge to the vertex v
	            currently being embedded will have the forward edge's index
	            stored in this field.  During Walkdown, each vertex for which
	            this field is set will cause a back edge to be embedded.
                Implicitly resets at each vertex step of the planarity method
	pertinentRootsList: used by Walkup to store a list of child bicomp roots of
                a vertex descendant of the current vertex that are pertinent
                and must be merged by the Walkdown in order to embed the cycle
                edges of the current vertex.  Future pertinent child bicomp roots
                are placed at the end of the list to ensure bicomps that are
                only pertinent are processed first.
    futurePertinentChild: indicates a DFS child with a lowpoint less than the
    			current vertex v.  This member is initialized to the start of
    			the sortedDFSChildList and is advanced in a relaxed manner as
    			needed until one with a lowpoint less than v is found or until
    			there are no more children.
    sortedDFSChildList: at the start of embedding, the list of DFS children of
    			this vertex is calculated in ascending order by DFI (sorted in
    			linear time). The list is used during Walkdown processing of
    			a vertex to process all of its children.  It is also used in
    			future pertinence management when processing the ancestors of
    			the vertex. When a child C is merged into the same bicomp as
    			the vertex, it is removed from the list.
	fwdArcList: at the start of embedding, the "back" edges from a vertex to
                its DFS *descendants* (i.e. the forward arcs of the back edges)
                are separated from the main adjacency list and placed in a
                circular list until they are embedded. The list is sorted in
                ascending DFI order of the descendants (in linear time).
                This member indicates a node in that list.

 PERTINENT()
 A vertex is pertinent in a partially processed graph if there is an
 unprocessed back edge between the vertex v whose edges are currently
 being processed and either the vertex or a DFS descendant D of the
 vertex not in the same bicomp as the vertex.

 The vertex is either directly adjacent to v by an unembedded back edge
 or there is an unembedded back edge (v, D) and the vertex is a cut
 vertex in the partially processed graph along the DFS tree path from
 D to v.

 Pertinence is a dynamic property that can change for a vertex after
 each edge addition.  In other words, a vertex can become non-pertinent
 during step v as more back edges to v are embedded.

/********************************************************************
 FUTUREPERTINENT()
 A vertex is future-pertinent in a partially processed graph if
 there is an unprocessed back edge between a DFS ancestor A of the
 vertex v whose edges are currently being processed and either
 theVertex or a DFS descendant D of theVertex not in the same bicomp
 as theVertex.

 Either theVertex is directly adjacent to A by an unembedded back edge
 or there is an unembedded back edge (A, D) and theVertex is a cut
 vertex in the partially processed graph along the DFS tree path from
 D to A.

 If no more edges are added to the partially processed graph prior to
 processing the edges of A, then the vertex would be pertinent.
 The addition of edges to the partially processed graph can alter
 both the pertinence and future pertinence of a vertex.  For example,
 if the vertex is pertinent due to an unprocessed back edge (v, D1) and
 future pertinent due to an unprocessed back edge (A, D2), then the
 vertex may lose both its pertinence and future pertinence when edge
 (v, D1) is added if D2 is in the same subtree as D1.

 Generally, pertinence and future pertinence are dynamic properties
 that can change for a vertex after each edge addition.

 Note that gp_UpdateVertexFuturePertinentChild() must be called before
 this macro. Since it is a statement and not a void expression, the
 desired commented out version does not compile (except with special
 compiler extensions not assumed by this code).
