 gp_TestEmbedResultIntegrity()

  This function tests the integrity of the graph result returned
  from gp_Embed().

  The caller of gp_Embed() does not have to save the original graph
  because, for efficiency, gp_Embed() operates on the input graph.
  However, to test the integrity of the result relative to the input,
  a copy of the input graph is required.

  Modules that extend/alter the behavior of gp_Embed() beyond the
  core planarity embedder and planarity obstruction isolator should
  also provide overriding integrity test routines appropriate to the
  extension algorithm.

  The main method first calls gp_SortVertices on theGraph, if the
  origGraph is not in DFI order (the common case).  Therefore,
  extension integrity tests can count on a consistent numbering
  between theGraph and the origGraph, either DFI order or pre-DFS
  order if that is the state of the origGraph.

  After all tests, the main method ensures theGraph is restored to
  DFI order by invoking gp_SortVertices if needed, thus ensuring
  that theGraph has the documented post-condition of gp_Embed().

  For an embedResult of OK, fpCheckEmbeddingIntegrity is invoked.
  The core planarity implementation does a face walk of all faces
  of the embedding.  It ensures that all edges were used in the face
  walk and that the right number of faces exist for the number of
  vertices and edges. Also, we ensure that all adjacencies expressed
  in the original graph still exist in the result graph.

  For an embedResult of NONEMBEDDABLE, fpCheckObstructionIntegrity
  is invoked.  The core planarity algorithm checks that the result
  graph is homeomorphic to K5 or K3,3 and that it is in fact a
  subgraph of the input graph.  Other algorithms use overloads to
  make appropriate checks.

  Returns NOTOK on integrity check failure or embedResult of NOTOK
          OK for successful integrity check of OK embedResult
          NONEMBEDDABLE for successful integrity check of an
                        embedResult of NONEMBEDDABLE

 _CheckEmbeddingFacialIntegrity()

 This function traverses all faces of a graph structure containing
 the planar embedding that results from gp_Embed().  The algorithm
 begins by placing all of the graph's arcs onto a stack and marking
 all of them as unvisited.  For each arc popped, if it is visited,
 it is immediately discarded and the next arc is popped.  Popping an
 unvisited arc e begins a face traversal.  We move to the true twin
 arc of e, and obtain its successor arc.  This amounts to always
 going clockwise or counterclockwise (depending on how the graph is
 drawn on the plane, or alternately whether one is above or below
 the plane).  This traversal continues until we make it back to the
 original arc e. Each arc along the way is marked as visited.  Further,
 if the successor arc has been visited, then there is an error since
 an arc can only appear in one face (the twin arc appears in a separate
 face, which is traversed in the opposing direction).
 If this algorithm succeeds without double visiting any arcs, and it
 produces the correct face count according to Euler's formula, then
 the embedding has all vertices oriented the same way.
 NOTE:  In disconnected graphs, the face reader counts the external
        face of each connected component.  So, we adjust the face
        count by subtracting one for each component, then we add one
        to count the external face shared by all components.

 RETURNS:   OK if theGraph contains a K_5 or K_{3,3} homeomorph,

 To be a K_5 homeomorph, there must be exactly 5 vertices of degree 4,
 which are called 'image' vertices, and all other vertices must be
 either degree 2 or degree 0. Furthermore, each of the image vertices
 must be able to reach all of the other image vertices by a single edge
 or a path of degree two vertices.

 To be a K_{3,3} homeomorph, there must be exactly 6 vertices of degree 3,
 which are called 'image' vertices, and all other vertices must be either
 degree 2 or degree 0.  Furthermore, the image vertices must be connected
 by edges or paths of degree two vertices in the manner suggested by
 a K_{3,3}.  To test this, we select an image vertex U, and determine
 three image vertices X, Y and Z reachable from U by single edges or
 paths of degree 2 vertices.  Then, we check that the two remaining image
 vertices, V and W, can also reach X, Y and Z by single edges or paths of
 degree 2 vertices.

 It is not necessary to check that the paths between the image vertices
 are distinct since if the paths had a common vertex, then the common
 vertex would not be degree 2.
